# Indexing Your Heart (Codename "Head Over Heels")

**Indexing Your Heart** is an upcoming visual novel/RPG mashup where you play as a software
engineer who has a secret admirer that you're actively dating who wears a hammer costume. The game
is a re-implementation of _Codename Katorin_ and _Codename Coyote Hammer_, using native Godot tools
Ã  la C# and the Dialogic library. The primary objective of this project is to continue developing
the game without worrying about smaller developer details that could be easily re-implemented with
an addon.

## Getting started: Build from source

**Required Tools**

- Godot 3.4 (Mono) or later
- .NET SDK 6 or later

**Optional Tools**

- Salmon 9 font family
- Swift 5.5 (or later) toolchain (or Xcode 13 or later)

Start by cloning the repository with `gh repo clone` and then open the project in Godot. Click
"Build" to build the solution and then click the Play button to run the game from within the Godot
editor.

### Building on Apple Silicon

To facilitate the build process for Apple Silicon Macs, the SDK build should be set to use the
dotnet CLI. Go to **Editor > Editor Settings > Mono > Builds** and change the build tool to
**dotnet CLI**. Godot will now build the project using the .NET SDK instead of Mono.

### Using Salmon 9 Fonts

By default, this project does _not_ include the Salmon 9 font family per its license agreement.
Instead, great open-source equivalents are provided so that the project builds and renders
correctly.

If you have purchased the Salmon 9 font family and want to use those fonts in the game, replace the
following files with the corresponding family variants:

- **Monospace** (`assets/fonts/mono.ttf`): Salmon Mono 9 Regular
- **Sans-serif** (`/assets/fonts/sans.ttf`): Salmon Sans 9 Regular
- **Serif** (`/assets/fonts/serif.ttf`): Salmon Serif 9 Regular

If you have not purchased the font and would like to do so, you can find the font on Phildjii's page
on Itch.io at https://phildjii.itch.io/salmon-family.

### Using the utilities package (Marteau)

The Marteau package (`utils`) includes utilities for handling helper functions such as:

- Updating build configurations
- Converting Markdown documents to Dialogic timelines
- Importing portraits into Dialogic quickly

More information how to build Marteau and its usage can be found in the documentation at
[utils/README.md](./utils/README.md).

> Note: You will need either a developer toolchain for Swift or Xcode as described in
> "Optional Tools" to build and run Marteau.
