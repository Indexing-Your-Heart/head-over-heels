# Private Access Builds

**Codename Katorin** is currently still in development, so access is limited to a private
access group, which includes supports on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/marquiskurt),
[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/alicerunsonfedora), and 
[Patreon](https://patreon.com/marquiskurt).

## How can I get access to the builds?

At present, **Codename Katorin** is very early in development and has no private access
builds available. In the future, if you are not a supporter, you will be able to register
for a mailing list that includes links to the builds as well as the developer logs for 
each build.
